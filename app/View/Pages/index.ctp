We strongly believe and advocate that our success in this world and Hereafter could be possible only by following the Commandments of the Holy Quran and the Sunnah.&nbsp;</p><p>Our belief is that the unity and brotherhood among all the Muslims are the pre-requisites of our victory over the evil forces.</p><p>Alhamdulillah, today this organization in its mission is working in 8 of 14 zones of Nepal.
